\title{Collect data from one sample}
\usage{
collect_one_sample_data(
  sample_id,
  connection_params = NULL,
  num_spectras = NULL,
  method = "inram"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_id}{The id of the sample to be collected}

\item{connection_params}{OPTIONAL: Connection parameters object created by the
\code{\link{create_connection_params}} function. If not provided, the
\code{\link{get_connection_params}} will look for such object in the global environment}

\item{num_spectras}{OPTIONAL Number of spectras to be downloaded (OPTIONAL, only if whole sample data not needed, e.g. for testing purposes)}

\item{method}{Once downloaded, data will be deserialized and assembled as a long dataframe,
either in RAM ("inram") or by creating small intermediate chunks on-disk ("ondisk").
Choosing the "ondisk" method can help on computer with low RAM and for large data samples,
but will be slower than the "inram" method.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{sample_dataset}} object, containing the sample data,
sample metadata and spectrum metadata datatables.
}
\description{
The function collects spectral data from a sample in a UNIFI Analysis.
First, asynchronous queries are performed for each sample.
Then, the data is deserialized by the function deserialize_data().
The S3 object containing the spectral data is adapted into a dataframe by the function outputlist_to_df().

\seealso{
\code{\link{save_one_sample_data}} to save collected data from the R environment to Parquet or HDF5 files, and \code{\link{convert_one_sample_data}} to both collect data and saving to files.
